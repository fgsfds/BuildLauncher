<b>BuildLauncher</b> is a frontend for Build Engine games inspired by *nstlaurent's* [DoomLauncher](https://github.com/nstlaurent/DoomLauncher)

It can download all major ports for Build Engine games, as well as mods, custom campaigns, and maps and launch them with the port of your choice.

Another goal of this project is to create a unification standard for Build Engine mods, campaigns, and map, so they can be launched with supported ports without any additional tweaking by users.
