At the time, it only included the Last Reaction and Water Bases episodes. Jaco released the final episode, Chimera, as a separate download on February 5, 2001. However, Jaco noted that he had lost his motivation to complete the episode, so he released Chimera in an incomplete form. Big City Nights, the last level of the Chimera episode, had a non-functioning Nuke Button, and it was missing a hidden area with a planned \u0022stargate\u0022 that would lead to a secret level. Four more levels were also planned: Deeper and Deeper, The Nest, The Hunt, and Another World. The final level was planned to feature a yellow alien boss that resembled the new enemy seen on the title screen. Mikko Sandt, an experienced level designer and owner of a Duke Nukem fan site, was able to connect with Jaco several years after the release of Chimera and offered to finish the episode on his behalf. Jaco agreed and provided Sandt with all the unused materials he had planned to use to finish the episode. However, there were not many unused materials. Using what little he was given, Sandt repurposed the scrapped materials to create Hidden Zone, a new final level for the mod. According to Sandt, Hidden Zone primarily consisted of two map files that he had merely stitched together. The new level was released on February 27, 2007 as a separate download. \r\n\r\n**For the first time ever, all of these separate releases have been merged into a single, cohesive mod for your convenience. Enjoy!**",

This means that all you need play it is Duke 3D with either the Plutonium Pak, or the Atomic Edition. The mod is designed and built in a traditional \u0027addon pack\u0027 style. It contains three groups of levels.\r\n\r\nThe first is a new single-player episode containing seven maps. This takes Duke on a new journey; starting in town near L.A, then travelling through canyons to an EDF earth base, a moon base, an alien mothership, and finally to his destination: Mars.\r\n\r\nThe second group of levels are designed exclusively for multiplayer. There are five Dukematch maps, set in a variety of locations, including the alien homeworld, Mars, and umm... something called \u0027Kwake\u0027.\r\n\r\nThe last episode contains maps for a new multiplayer game: \u0027Arena\u0027. In an Arena game, two players fight to the death in a map no bigger than a few rooms. All maps are different, but each map also features one specific weapon. As soon as a player spawns they are given that weapon with infinite ammunition.\r\nThe single-player episode features three new enemies and a new boss. In Duke\u0027s favour there are also two new weapons; the \u0027Fire-Thrower\u0027, which spits out flames and can be used to rapidly set fire to large areas. There is also a prototype weapon, the \u0027Forcegun\u0027. This is basically a force-field in a gun - as well as damaging enemies it also propels them away. Naturally, these weapons are also available in Dukematch and Arena games.\r\n\r\n*Uses modified .grp from the EDuke32 Addon Compilation by NightFright*\r\nhttps://forums.duke4.net/topic/7640-release-eduke32-addon-compilation/",

Polymost renderer is recommended, even though it should also work with Classic and Polymer.\r\n\r\nWG Space: 9 space maps (2 secret) with a lot of remarkable architecture. There are only a few space episodes out there, and even less which are done well, but this is one of them. Tons of details, very balanced gameplay and gloomy space action. What else do you need?\r\n\r\nWG Realms: 6 levels (1 intro/3 regular/1 secret/1 boss map) which almost completely revamp the original game with a lot of new textures and custom sounds. Exotic places like a medieval castle, a huge hi-tech  area, enormous caves or the Egyptian showdown location make this trip into a weird parallel dimension highly enjoyable and worth playing. If you liked Epic\u0027s \u0022Unreal\u0022, then this is something you have to check out for sure!\r\n\r\nWG Pandora: City episode that added for v4.0 of this collection, featuring 7 maps.

One new opponent has been added, a robot which is throwing grenades at you and can even harm you after you finished it off and get too close. Some guns have new sounds.\r\n\r\nSome new ideas are an electric fence that can damage you, malfunctioning pipebomb/nightvision pickups, Coke health, fake Atomic Health with only a \u002B5 bonus or mines which explode when you step on them.\r\n\r\n*Uses modified .grp from the EDuke32 Addon Compilation by NightFright*\r\nhttps://forums.duke4.net/topic/7640-release-eduke32-addon-compilation/",

Being so popular, this franchise have spawned countless fan works, such as mods \u0026 maps for various games, including Duke 3D. Sadly, most of the projects are either have very few levels (AVD, Alien), or simply aren\u0027t polished enough, such as the case with ifamous Alien Extermination (AKA Alienz TC), released in 2000.\r\n\r\nAlienz TC was one of the first Duke 3D mods I\u0027ve ever played, and it always confused the hell out of me. It has tons of levels, some of which are quite good, but it also has tons of bugs, questionable artwork, no original music (plays standard Duke 3D tracks) \u0026 lots of unused content. Even the gameplay is extremely unbalanced. It bugs me that such huge TC is so underdeveloped and unpolished, unlike other mods, such as the classic Aliens TC for DOOM, for example. This is why I decided to make Alienz TC: New Edition. I honestly think Alien Extermination has a lot of potential, and after updating it and fixing numorous errors, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. If you\u0027re a fan of Aliens and you never played the original Alienz TC, this is a good opportunity to try it out!\r\n\r\n*Uses modified .grp from the EDuke32 Addon Compilation by NightFright*\r\nhttps://forums.duke4.net/topic/7640-release-eduke32-addon-compilation/",

At first he thinks another serious inmate is being given a cold shower, but then he notices a rather eerie silence hanging over the place. He could hear unearthly moans and grisly noises in the distance. A security guard burst in, a knife buried in his spine, and collapsed upon the floor, dead. Even with slight psychosis Chris can tell something is very, very wrong. He dresses swiftly in his civilian clothes and trenchcoat, and arms himself with the deceased guard\u0027s gun.\r\n\r\nAs he prepares to face whatever is waiting for him outside the door, a thin and baffling smile crosses his face.\r\n\r\n*Uses modified .grp from the EDuke32 Addon Compilation by NightFright*\r\nhttps://forums.duke4.net/topic/7640-release-eduke32-addon-compilation/",

Betting is a risky business, especially when there is a corrupt rat lurking in your favorite team. That\u0027s what happened to our hero: Canadian hockey player Adam Ace received a tempting offer to drain the final match of the World Cup in exchange for eternal life and sold his incorruptible soul to the well-known Cabal sect. What does sports have to do with it, you ask? The thing is that tired of immortality and endless wanderings, Caleb found an outlet in sports betting and put all his fortune accumulated over a long time spent under the wing of fortune and a unique flair for victory on the above-mentioned unfortunate national team. This leads to another question: what about the Bondage of this? The answer is immediately revealed - knowing that Caleb will not forgive Ace for such a setup of the maple leaf country (and in fact the loss of money), the goal of the distraught fanatics who lost their great and powerful, to track down, find and destroy our dead man, so to speak, for bait.",

I hope you\u0027ll enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed making it. Be aware though, that not all maps are what you would expect from a Blood level, it\u0027s not all bloody mayhem. Don\u0027t be disappointed if the TC doesn\u0027t fit your ideas about how a 3d-shooter should be, much of it is about atmosphere rather than action, you will benefit from approaching BloodLines with an open mind. This is the beta version of the first three episodes, including 13 maps, two new enemies and loads of new art and sound",

Wu in March in order to gather some of the best builders around the globe to build one of the most fun-filled episodes for Shadow Warrior. This episode consists of five main missions (many including more than one level), one secret mission, four WangBang levels, and a few other in-between levels. The Lights Out team poured their hearts and souls into this episode, and we wish that you will have as much fun playing it as we had making it.",
