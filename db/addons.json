Betting is a risky business, especially when there is a corrupt rat lurking in your favorite team. That\u0027s what happened to our hero: Canadian hockey player Adam Ace received a tempting offer to drain the final match of the World Cup in exchange for eternal life and sold his incorruptible soul to the well-known Cabal sect. What does sports have to do with it, you ask? The thing is that tired of immortality and endless wanderings, Caleb found an outlet in sports betting and put all his fortune accumulated over a long time spent under the wing of fortune and a unique flair for victory on the above-mentioned unfortunate national team. This leads to another question: what about the Bondage of this? The answer is immediately revealed - knowing that Caleb will not forgive Ace for such a setup of the maple leaf country (and in fact the loss of money), the goal of the distraught fanatics who lost their great and powerful, to track down, find and destroy our dead man, so to speak, for bait.",

It contains five new enemies! Over 35\u002B secrets to be found and dozens of side areas to explore! Randomized keycodes and clues for secrets. Meaning each time you play the code and clue will be unique! Modern effects like patrolling enemies and low gravity!",

This time we\u0027ve gone far beyond simple fan map-making and are going to prove to you that Blood is not this hopeless even without source code. From the beginning BAITD was aimed at expanding gameplay, it can\u0027t be limited by common gameplay borders, so here you\u0027re going to see a lot of new features.",

We have admitted that BloodLines will never be fully completed and have decided to release the TC \u0022as is\u0022 with some retouching to make incomplete maps actually playable. I hope you\u0027ll enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed making it. Be aware though, that not all maps are what you would expect from a Blood level, it\u0027s not all bloody mayhem. Don\u0027t be disappointed if the TC doesn\u0027t fit your ideas about how a 3d-shooter should be, much of it is about atmosphere rather than action, you will benefit from approaching BloodLines with an open mind. This is the beta version of the first three episodes, including 13 maps, two new enemies and loads of new art and sound",
