Being so popular, this franchise have spawned countless fan works, such as mods \u0026 maps for various games, including Duke 3D. Sadly, most of the projects are either have very few levels (AVD, Alien), or simply aren\u0027t polished enough, such as the case with ifamous Alien Extermination (AKA Alienz TC), released in 2000.\r\n\r\nAlienz TC was one of the first Duke 3D mods I\u0027ve ever played, and it always confused the hell out of me. It has tons of levels, some of which are quite good, but it also has tons of bugs, questionable artwork, no original music (plays standard Duke 3D tracks) \u0026 lots of unused content. Even the gameplay is extremely unbalanced. It bugs me that such huge TC is so underdeveloped and unpolished, unlike other mods, such as the classic Aliens TC for DOOM, for example. This is why I decided to make Alienz TC: New Edition. I honestly think Alien Extermination has a lot of potential, and after updating it and fixing numorous errors, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. If you\u0027re a fan of Aliens and you never played the original Alienz TC, this is a good opportunity to try it out!",

      "Description": "*This uses a modified .grp from the EDuke32 Addon Compilation by NightFright*\r\nhttps://www.moddb.com/mods/back-in-business\r\nThe main focus for the maps in this episode was to create a strong sense of objective in each level (more elaborate than the usual button/keycard hunting). I was aiming at shorter type of levels at first, which probably is true in the case of first two maps \u2013 but as the work on the episode progressed, so did the length of the levels. Having different objectives to complete in each level made the flow of the levels more nonlinear, which again can be especially observed in first two levels, where you have a couple of parallel objectives that can be undertaken in any order. In case of the next levels, the nonlinearity is less obvious and more depending on details \u2013 some player choices might result in slightly different outcomes to the gameplay, or multiple strategies can be undertaken for certain events. Also, these two levels are more open for exploration.\r\nI wanted the design of the levels to be a compromise of good aesthetics, details and shadows with memorable gameplay and effects/sequencing. There are some effects and sequencing which may feel a bit less intuitional to the players who are used to the game mechanics for past 25 years. The custom coding was kept to a minimal level \u2013 one of the most satisfying things in Duke mapping for me has always been finding creative ways of achieving \u201Cinnovative\u201D effects through a combination of vanilla game Build engine tricks and quirks. Same goes for design \u2013 while initially I was more keen on using custom textures, over the time I\u2019ve found them not really that good looking in Duke and mostly limited myself to using the original tileset. Especially in the 4th level, most of the odd looking stuff you can come across will usually serve some gameplay purpose.\r\nThe progression between the levels might not be what you would normally expect from an episode \u2013 the maps aren\u2019t interconnected (besides the mission briefing levels which precede levels 2 and 3), as Duke is sent on his missions by the EDF. As such, you will not be able to keep the items from previous levels most of the time \u2013 but then again, during mission briefings you will be generously equipped for what\u2019s ahead of you. I wanted the connection between the levels to be mostly kept by the narrative and objective based levels, not by the location. This also allowed to make each map have a different theme to it.\r\nThe completion times shown at the end of each level were taken from my playthroughs on Piece of Cake (3D Realms time) or roughly from impressions of the beta-testers (Par time). Hope you will enjoy playing this episode as much as I have enjoyed making it!",

Nope, \u0022It\u0027s those bloody damn things again!\u0022 he says, and then something twinged in his brain, he\u0027d had enough. \u0022I\u0027m going to kill every damn one of those bastards!\u0022.",

This means that all you need play it is Duke 3D with either the Plutonium Pak, or the Atomic Edition. The mod is designed and built in a traditional \u0027addon pack\u0027 style. It contains three groups of levels.\r\nThe first is a new single-player episode containing seven maps. This takes Duke on a new journey; starting in town near L.A, then travelling through canyons to an EDF earth base, a moon base, an alien mothership, and finally to his destination: Mars.\r\nThe second group of levels are designed exclusively for multiplayer. There are five Dukematch maps, set in a variety of locations, including the alien homeworld, Mars, and umm... something called \u0027Kwake\u0027.\r\nThe last episode contains maps for a new multiplayer game: \u0027Arena\u0027. In an Arena game, two players fight to the death in a map no bigger than a few rooms. All maps are different, but each map also features one specific weapon. As soon as a player spawns they are given that weapon with infinite ammunition.\r\nThe single-player episode features three new enemies and a new boss. In Duke\u0027s favour there are also two new weapons; the \u0027Fire-Thrower\u0027, which spits out flames and can be used to rapidly set fire to large areas. There is also a prototype weapon, the \u0027Forcegun\u0027. This is basically a force-field in a gun - as well as damaging enemies it also propels them away. Naturally, these weapons are also available in Dukematch and Arena games.\r\n",

A young upstart scientist named Epala was studying trans-dimension shifting enhancements when accidentally discovering how to alter time and space. His invention could now allow the Shoven to travel back in time. Evalist caught news of this development from an scientist friend. Evalist desperately wanted to question Epala alone before proceeding with a full Council meeting. It was too late. Epala built a network of military staff contacts and had already met with the Military Division Council Member who after questioning him called for an emergency Council Meeting. Evalist was both angered and frustrated by the new invention. It could unravel all the work he risked his very life to accomplish. Evalist realized more than most that he was charting the future of the Shoven species. Someone else had realized this as well. And that person or persons probably have another direction in mind with this new technology and new Bakpri army. Imagine combining time travel, plasma weaponry and legions of battle-hardened warriors.\r\n\r\nA disaster was brewing.",

It was an alien-made plague which killed about 60% of the earth\u0027s population. Those who were left started their plans against the alien army. Duke was sent to find out if there are any fellows left in the EDF\u0027s main facility. He was also given a mission from the top: Kill all enemy forces by defeating the new Emperor. This can be done only by going through the bases, cities and died human bodies to reach the moon station where\u0027s the current base of operation of the new alien emperor.\r\n-Fate of mankind is in your hands.",

Since then Duke decided to join the Earth Defense Forces as a trainer for the young soldiers and, when in specific situations, help them accomplish their missions to protect the fragile world we live in. However, even if Duke hasn\u0027t had the practise of kicking alien ass in quite some time, the veteran badass hasn\u0027t changed one bit. Gyms, nightclubs and burger stores are a typical day in Duke\u0027s life. Although the life is easy these days for the humans and nothing bothers their hardly noticeable lives, a plan is taking shape in a brain somewhere...Hidden far underground, the survivors of the one-man army assault in the alien invasion a couple of years ago slowly recover their strenghth and numbers. They have sworn revenge - On the Earth, its citizens, its cities; and most of all, on their saviour, Duke Nukem, agent of the Earth Defense Forces. Secretly, a team of alien troops have established their own bases in former military areas all over the world. Using the current technology, as well as their own, the aliens have developed a new era of weapons - all of them bound to destroy the pitiful creatures that beat them down those years ago. Two weeks ago it was brought to EDF\u0027s attention that several abandoned military facilities throughout the world was put into use, and that there was impossible to achieve contact with them. Agents were sent to\r\nareas to report about these strange incidents, but no one ever returned. Expecting the worst, EDF immediately contacted Duke and briefed him about the situation at hand. Furious, Duke accepted the mission on one condition: that no aliens would be left alive. \u0022This is the last time,\u0022 said Duke, \u0022the friggin\u0027 last time those aliens are gonna piss me off.\u0022",

I went through all of the Duke Xtreme single player maps and set them up for multiplayer for Megaton Edition.

So, when I finally got my own Saturn and played the game, I couldn\u0027t resist not to make a PC version of the level. I ported the level without using any converting tools and it\u0027s slightly different from the original version (the layout is the same, though). I also used some tricks to emulate the features of the SlaveDriver engine. Have fun!\r\nP.S - the original version is hard as hell, because of the instant deathtraps, and it took me many tries to complete. God I hate the Saturn Port, it\u0027s so unfair at times.",

All levels have been adapted so that Co-op play is not only possible, but enhanced with a helpful checkpoint system. The campaign includes several secret levels which all connect back to their episodes through special transitional missions.\r\n\r\nThe entire mod was developed by a single mapper, Bloatoid, who has been editing with the Build engine for many years. The original Death Wish was created between January 2010 and October 2011. Updates have been made over the years based on feedback from players and observing online streamers, as well as the addition of several extra secret levels. A 4th episode is in development.\r\n\r\nLet the festival of Blood continue!\r\n\r\nIncludes Soundtrack Addon by Speedy\r\n\r\nhttps://www.moddb.com/mods/death-wish-for-blood/downloads/dw-soundtrack-addon-by-speedy",

While taking care to never stray far from the gameplay formula that made BLOOD so gripping, the campaign will see Caleb journey through new environments that he has not seen before. Gruesome new discoveries await as Caleb tears through hordes of the undead, and nothing is left unscathed in his quest for vengeance.The version 1.1 release contains the following features:\r\n\r\n- 2 episodes consisting of 18 maps total, which fully support Single Player, Co-operative, BloodBath and Capture the Flag across all difficulty settings.\r\n\r\n- A series of exhilarating, all new, low resolution cutscenes which tell the campaign\u0027s story.\r\n\r\n- Lots of new, chilling music as an optional extra.\r\n\r\n- A splash of custom art that is used sparingly.\r\n\r\n- A large amount of fiendish secrets waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\n- Challenging and occasionally downright unfair encounters with BLOOD\u0027s monsters, unsuitable for those whose faith is weak.\r\n\r\n- Support for the NBlood and BloodGDX ports - to a point.",

Betting is a risky business, especially when there is a corrupt rat lurking in your favorite team. That\u0027s what happened to our hero: Canadian hockey player Adam Ace received a tempting offer to drain the final match of the World Cup in exchange for eternal life and sold his incorruptible soul to the well-known Cabal sect. What does sports have to do with it, you ask? The thing is that tired of immortality and endless wanderings, Caleb found an outlet in sports betting and put all his fortune accumulated over a long time spent under the wing of fortune and a unique flair for victory on the above-mentioned unfortunate national team. This leads to another question: what about the Bondage of this? The answer is immediately revealed - knowing that Caleb will not forgive Ace for such a setup of the maple leaf country (and in fact the loss of money), the goal of the distraught fanatics who lost their great and powerful, to track down, find and destroy our dead man, so to speak, for bait.",
